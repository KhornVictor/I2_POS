âœ… BASIC OPERATIONS ON PRODUCT DATA

1. Sorting
    Sort products by:
        Price (ascending/descending)
        Stock (to find low or high inventory)
        Brand or Category (alphabetically)

2. Filtering  
    Show only products from:
        A specific Brand (e.g., Coca-Cola)  
        A certain Category (e.g., Snacks)
        Price under $5
        Stock less than 50 (low inventory)

3. Searching
    Find a product by name or ID

4. Grouping & Aggregation
    Count products by Category or Brand
    Average price per category

5. Checking Inventory
    Which products have stock below a threshold (e.g., < 30)?
    Out-of-stock products (stock == 0)

6. Adding or Removing Products
    Add new rows to the CSV (e.g., new products)
    Remove discontinued products
